+ Fix the numarable at the end, insted of (1) do just 1
+when opening a app have a author auto selected to the one used previously
+when exit through the red cross then save aouthr to config
+ check is "by [author]" present before renaming, because when regular renaming it is just appending the author name to the file name 
+make the char name same format and usage as author name or vise versa
+implemet that thing from the previous tries where if files does not much, there is an option to add new Char name to the dictionry by selecting the name from new File name
+Add Undo Functionality
+some times when creating a new author the name of that author is the actual folder name ( so maybe a constructor from which can  select an author name - similar to the adding a new char name)
+Enable users to add, remove, or edit character names within the application.
+Enable users to add, remove, or edit Authors within the application.

- maybe separate the code even more (creating) ( remanimg by name or author)

- have ability to just have name of the authors( no chars)
 
- delete author or Char name (maybe show a list to select from what to delete)

-better UI
  -improve to look like file explorer 
  -make better status bar
